# App Reviews Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

This project involves the analysis of app reviews using sentiment analysis techniques. The dataset consists of two columns: "Review" containing textual feedback and "Rating" with corresponding numerical ratings. We utilize TextBlob to label the data with sentiments (Positive, Negative, or Neutral) based on polarity scores.

## Exploring the Data

We systematically explore the data by analyzing the distribution of ratings, examining the length of reviews, and deriving insights from the textual content. The dataset is then labeled with sentiments, providing a basis for sentiment analysis.

## Sentiment Analysis

We perform sentiment analysis by analyzing the distribution of sentiments across the dataset. Despite low ratings, we observe a limited use of negative words in the reviews.

## Relationship Between Sentiments and Ratings

Next, we investigate the connection between sentiments and ratings, aiming to understand if there's a correlation between the sentiment expressed in the text and the numerical rating.

## Text Analysis

To gain further insights, we conduct text analysis to identify common words or themes within each sentiment category. Word clouds are generated to visualize the most frequently occurring words in positive, negative, and neutral reviews.
